# so u only use range for the for loop? not really but yeah usually # kay i got this :)) 
# for the next quizzes if i need to use loop i will try both

# im not sweating i just felt relief af :))) finally got it
# ur a dumb ass but ur doing fine dont sweat
# good
# do the next quiz then we will move on to nested loop # wtf nested loop exist? :)))) fuckckkckckckckckcck
# which is double the fun
# yayyy
# gonna go now
# upload to git and do the next one # kay # kay bitch ill send them to u later
